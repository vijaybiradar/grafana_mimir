The role of Prometheus
Prometheus instances scrape samples from various targets and push them to Grafana Mimir by using Prometheusâ€™ remote write API. 
ServiceMonitor for Prometheus

label release: kube-prometheus-stack, which is what allows the Prometheus operator to discover which exporter services to scrape. 
I verified through the Prometheus interface that the Mimir metrics were being scraped. Then I followed the instructions in the Grafana Mimir documentation to build the Mimir dashboards.

I configured three separate buckets named mimir-alert, mimir-ruler-test, and mimir-tsdb
